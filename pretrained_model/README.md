### Download Pre-Trained Model

Step 1) Download the pre-trained model and all its utility files (anchor_embedding, hyperparameter, model_parameter)
from [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zwbq4lXEhLsJfm2l6PWp9lHvMRrZxkeJ/view?usp=sharing) google drive.

Step 2) Extract the folder and copy the content in this directory 'pretrained_model'. This folder needs to be in the root
directory. 

Step 3) Verify whether it successfully loaded by executing the streamlit app. (Before doing that, check whether the 
demo data is loaded.) In order to start the streamlit app you need to enter following command into the terminal 
(while being in project root):

     $ streamlit run FaceRecognitionApp.py
